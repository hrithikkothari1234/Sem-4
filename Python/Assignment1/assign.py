Data structures :
1) List :
    In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square bracket [ ],
    separated by commas.
    It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.).
    Also, a list can even have another list as an item.
    Lists are mutable.

    eg.
    ->l1=[1,2,3]
    ->l1.append(4)
    ->l1.remove(2)
    ->l1.pop()

2) Tuple :
    A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas.
    In someways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing,
    nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable unlike lists which are mutable.

    eg.
    ->t1=(1,2,3)
    ->t1.insert(4)
    ->t1.count(2)

3) Sets :
    A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
    Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.
    The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list,
    is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
    This is based on a data structure known as a hash table.

    eg.
    ->s1={1,2,3}
    ->s1.add(5)
    ->s1=set([1,2,3,4,4,4])

4) Dictionary :
    A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
    In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
    They are basically key-value pairs just like JSON(Javascript object notation).

    eg.
    ->d1={1:1,2:4,3:9,4:16}
    ->d1={(1,2,3):[1,2,3,4],(5,6,7):[1,2,3,3]}

Suppose u and v both have values of type set and u^v == u - v. From this we can

d. v is a subset of u -- Correct ans

Justification :

a. This is true for any u and v.

c. The set v should be a subset of u. -- Correct ans
